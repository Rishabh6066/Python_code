'''
Write a Python progrma that uses a lambda function to filter and transform a
list of integers based on the following  criteria:

filter out numbers that are not divisible by 3
Transform the remaining numbers by squaring them.

numbers = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 21]

o/p- [9,36,225,441]

# # Given list of numbers
# numbers = [1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 21]

# # Filter numbers that are divisible by 3
# filter = list(filter(lambda x: x % 3 != 0, numbers))
# print(filter)

# a = list(filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, numbers))

# # Transform the remaining numbers by squaring them
# transformed_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, a))

# # Output the transformed numbers
# print(transformed_numbers)
